Digital trainer kit, Relay, Potentiometer, CRO etc,.
Franchise...Niranjan etc,.
IOT key

Legally no problem in our concept
	w.r.t hardware
	w.r.t OS(Linux disros) ,,,has kannada versions also.
Problem is stock availability...once this clears..big players may come into picture
Windows CE OS is the only option...there might some legal problems here
	Have to see Windows 10 IOT core

Can't patent in this form
add few things and patent it..be quick in it..

Is patent needed for this concept?
Dealing with local bigger players...
	Do things silently..don't make noise...
	Add some extra features..i.e have some your own IP..
		have something that's really tough and complex to implment
		as well it should have good user value.

IOT is the hotcake
Arduino nano is cost effective..Raspberry pi 0
encash both.
