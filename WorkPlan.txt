Boards Targeted
	Beaglebone
	Raspberry Pi
	ARM
	Arduino Uno
	Leave AtMega, PIC or such smaller boards...They will make things complex
		Do them only if you really free and really interested
	Leave FPGA..Because needs VHDL to learn
MIPS, MSP430, GPU

Every month's work could be a
	Workshop's topic(2 day or 3 day)	
	or a Module in EC's ESDP

Module's complexity varies from college to college
	Haalu bekaadavarige haalu
	Majjige bekaadavarige majjige
	Neeru bekaadavarige neeru

Finish the basic ones and importants ones in complex things first
Goto field for execution
While in field, do the complex ones parallely


Mainly digital things (MCU Coding) 
Minimal analog work(soldering, Transistors, FETs, Opamps etc,.){Because time consuming}


Perspective --> everything at the indusry level
Not all things needs to be done by us, collobrate wherever its worth
=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
Other things (important after few years)
	1. that are simple and less stressed
		Using Different types of switches,
		Non Electronic essential Suplemenetaries:
			PCB Boards, Bends, Cardboards, Solder,
			Project box making,	giving aesthic look to project - a demo, 

		General Simulation Software usages for different simulators - Basics
		Some spy projects - frequency detection of the mobile, decoding the transmitted message
		Basics: Transistors, Diodes, Transformers, Opamps, FETs/MOSFETs		
		
	2. that are complex
		Android basics
		labview interface, 
		Robotic arm control	
		Control System Projects
		Routing protocols burning to routers
		Antenna Control Basics
		Example WSN(for visualization of how a WSN looks)
		Examples on FPGA, CMOS
=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
When we prepare to ALL the above, 
	we can sell it to ANYBODY -- school kids, diploma, Engg, M.tech, Industry people
	we will be UNBEATABLE(Yes..its takes time to finish all the above.. and THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF
		IT.. Because thats what makes us unbeatable...All it needs is continuous dedicated work
		for 2-3 years. It justs needs us to cross the river once...on the other side we have a 
		beautiful land)
		(Most of the people waste their 2-3 years of life to prepare for IAS with an 
		 UNGARUANTEED success and most of them(99%) will fail and waste those years..
		 whereas us, rather than doing that, we will be INVESTING those years on to our 
		 GARUANTEED bright future)
=================================================================================================

Some thoughts

Workshops on 
	IOT, Image Processing, Boards Comparison, Communication Technologies Comparison,
	latex, poster design, CS for EC students(Client-Server, Basic Webpages, Basic Database etc,.)
	How to box the project to look like an endproduct
	Choose a board - Demo on using ALL the features that a board presents
	latest trends in electronics (for final year students, industry people, entreprenaurs)
Tutorials
	Modules for general BE EC & TC
	Modules specific for M.Tech Branches
	Modules specific for technologies like IOT, Image Processing, Energy Harversting
Workshop materials on major current topics(recent trends)
Project work guidance workshops
	(All elementary/Basic operations...none specific project algorithm/task implementation)
=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
Note:
At the end of any session, create the zeal to have a paper under their name.
Create clients for Journal Work
	(All these things discussed above need JUST ONE TIME preparation...so those things doesn't
	consume your time in long run...AT THIS TIME start to take JOURNAL WORK...i.e., finish all
	the workshop/ESDP materials...then goto JOURNAL WORK and INDUSTRY LEVEL PROJECT WORKS)
Say we can give service of supplying any paper in IEEE + Springer + Elsevier
=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
Target Audiences/2nd persons
	Engg. Colleges
	Industry Peoples (To train new recruits, To train new companies' staff)
=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
Possibilites( People call us for)
	Workshops
	Tutorials - elonged workshops, ESDP
	People will also call for setting up the environment itself for sure
	Removers of strucking points in projects
		(only guiding + pointing to or giving some resources(related example codes))
	Industries call us to train their staff
	One point contact for all technical stuff 
		(to supply materials, to help in publishing, to help in projects packaging by giving
		 related contact points, providing platforms to demonstrate their work, to direct the 
		 people in need to right industry persons or academic persons)
		 Basically, bridge between Bangalore and Non-Bangalore...or rather bridge between the
		 sinks and sources
	For arranging Industry visits for students
=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
Thought Transfers
	Demo on identifying the project oppurtunities by OBSERVING the real world.
		that is --> Sensing of oppurtunities spectrum Ex,. Thottilu thugoo machine
	Decomposing the products to small elementary operations(i.e., simplify complex things)
		ex. trimmer = oscillator+motor, sprinkler = servomotor + relay, Car's key = digital 
		encoder + RF tx., Google eye = camera interfacing + custom MCU(small size) + placing
		it gives students a feeling that,YES,Even great things are also made of simple stuff only
	Interfacing electronics to daily usable home objects - TV, DVD, Fridge, Fan, cycle/byke, car,
		Spectacles etc,. (i.e putting the electronics to practical usage)
		Ex. tachometer ->  you can use it to find cycle/byke speed, Fan's RPM, Motor's RPm etc,.
	Basic Computer design - (Keyboard + Mouse + LCD Screen or Screen with COM Port + 
		Some FAMILIAR MCU...ex, using Beagle bone to create a computer(Awesome!!!))
	
	Show some vintage electronic stuff, i.e,. show evolution of electronics.
		ex. Show the older to newer generation mouses & explain the difference in working of them
	Give a demo of the small projetcs that were conducted by Jobs and Gates that made them.
	  (Yes... projects that made them famous are small and simple when compared to today's 
	   projects... take MORAL points out of this observation)
	Design and demo of china products like card readers, LED bulb control, clocks, mosquito bats,
		calling bells etc,....To create small entreprenurs(under our shadow).
	e-mail writing

Sandeep Sir

Reviewer for journal papers
Advisory committee member for Vignana Taranga
He will be active participants in vignana tharanga (+ maybe Sripathy Sir)
As a gudie to industry level projects
	Ex. project -- creating IOT environment in office
		He will guide us in develoing code or he himself may write code
		We do rest of the work(marketing, peripheral interfacing, giving it a product look etc,.)
		i.e,. he will do the CORE work and we do the remaining...he will be the brain, we will be
		the hands and legs.
=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
Investment(minimum andru)

1 Set of all boards
USB Cables, Jumper wires.
LEDs, Breadboards, tools(screw driver, wire cutter)
1 set of sensors, motors, camera etc,.
=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
Money prinicples

Cost all services higher...because the work deserves it.
don't reduce the cost even for those who are willing to pay
minimum cost only for students who are humble or badavaru
i say overcharge those who does ganchali
charge even for the free codesamples that are available in internet
	you are not responsible for their ignorance.
	if they know about it,then only reduce the cost.
=================================================================================================
=================================================================================================
